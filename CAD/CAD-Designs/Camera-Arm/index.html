    <h1>Camera Arm</h1>
    <img id="thumbnail" src="IMG_3533_3.webp" alt="Camera arm thumbnail">
    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>
      I use this to hold my phone still while taking photos or videos. 
      It allows for consistent photos, and I can film myself doing my projects.
    </p>
    <p>
      For example, the timelapse on this <a href="/Projects/Flip-Flop-Circuit/index.html#timelapse">page</a> used the camera arm.

    <h2>Designing</h2>
    <img width="100%" src="Camera-Arm-CAD_3.webp" alt="Camera Arm CAD">
    <p>CAD from <a href="/CAD/What-Is-CAD/index.html#fusion">Fusion</a></p>
    <p>There are many things that went into this design to make it 3D printable.</p>
    <h3>The Clamp</h3>
    <div class="image-text-section">
      <div>
        <p>The clamp consists of 3 parts</p>
        <ol>
          <li>Clamp main section</li>
          <li>Threaded section</li>
          <li>Screw</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
          The reason the clamp is split into the threaded section is so I can print 
          the thread vertically, running the layer lines across rather than vertically
          (increasing the strength of the clamp), and remove the need for supports.
        </p>
        <p>
          This then attaches to the base of the arm using screws.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>
    <h3>The Arm</h3>
    <div class="image-text-section">
      <div>
        <p>The arm consists of a series of screw joints.</p>
        <p>Simply tighten the screw to hold the joint in place.</p>
        <p>
          The simple design also allows for customization. I could add 2 more
          arms to this if I wanted to, no extra design needed.
        </p>
      </div>

    </div>
    <h3>The Camera Clamp</h3>
    <div class="image-text-section">
      <div>
        <p>The camera uses a vise-like mechanism to hold the phone in place.</p>
        <p>Just tighten the screw to hold the phone down.</p>
        <p>While this part may seem simple at first glance, take a close look at the top piece.</p>
        <p>
          The big problem is that the screw has to spin within this part. It might be possible to print 
          this in place using supports, but the layer alignment is not ideal. Certain parts of
          the print would look ugly due to the supports. That is why I broke 
          this piece into 3 separate parts that are held together by 2 M3 screws.

    <h2>Thoughts</h2>
    <p>
      Overall it works and for a 3D printed camera arm, it works really well, and it 
      has proven to be extremely helpful when it comes to designing this website. 
      The biggest annoyance is whenever it is bumped, it takes a long time for the shaking of the arm to go away.
